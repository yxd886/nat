About
-----
WrapSix is a fast NAT64 implementation. You also need a DNS64 server (e.g. BIND).

Installation
------------
For installation use standard ./configure && make && make install commands.

Configuration
-------------
WrapSix uses configuration file wrapsix.conf from configuration directory set in
"./configure" phase, which is by default /usr/local/etc. You can also specify
custom configuration file in runtime -- just pass its path as an argument:

# wrapsix ./wrapsix.conf

Running
-------
It can be run by `wrapsix` command as root.
